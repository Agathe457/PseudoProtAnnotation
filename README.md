# Structure-based annotation of bacteriophage proteins:  A case study of *Pseudomonas* infecting phages

Code repository associated with the dissertation presented in fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Science: Bioinformatics

Research conducted at the lab of Computational Systems Biology of prof. Vera van Noort, Department of Microbial and Molecular Systems, Centre of Microbial and Plant Genetics and the lab of Gene Technology of prof. Rob Lavigne, Department of Biosystems, Division Animal and Human Health Engineering with daily supervision by Hannelore Longin.

- Stage 1: Creating a dataset of proteins of unknown function from *Pseudomonas* infecting phages
- Stage 2: Structure prediction and comparitive analysis
- Stage 3: Structure-based protein annotation and gouping
- Stage 4: Case-study structure prediction and annotation within one cluster
